# expanseElectronics Artnet Node Software (gen 3)

**Please select the node generation from the branch menu above.**
**You are currently in the 3rd Generation branch.**


### **About:**
As a lighting technician, I often have to run cables across walkways, moving props, or only awkward places to run a wire. Wouldn't it be nice to have a wireless solution? While there are many commercial units available using various protocols, they are either expensive or unreliable. With our product, you could have any show set up within hours! With its slim and compact design, it fits right in your pocket! With the implementation of Wi-Fi, there is no need to worry about cables. Stored scenes allow for instant playback through the web interface with nearly no latency. 

### **Some demos:**
Before selling these on Tindie, I have used them in many productions thus far. Most recently on a Cambridge Theatre Company production (Chicago) in my local school's theatre [(Leys Great Hall)](https://www.theleys.net/591/venue-hire/great-hall) where we used two of our nodes to control some Robe T1s that were mounted above the circle balcony (no dmx signal there). It took us only five minutes to have both nodes talk to each other and patched them into Artnet. The show went smoothly!

**Our third-generation reduces latency, provides USB programmability, allows for DMX inputs, RDM compatible, and can support PixelFX.
