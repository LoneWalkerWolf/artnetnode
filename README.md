### **About:**
As a lighting technician, I often have to run cables across walkways, moving props, or only awkward places to run a wire. Wouldn't it be nice to have a wireless solution? While there are many commercial units available using various protocols, they are either expensive or unreliable. With our product, you could have any show set up within hours! With its slim and compact design, it fits right in your pocket! With the implementation of Wi-Fi, there is no need to worry about cables. Stored scenes allow for instant playback through the web interface with nearly no latency. 

### **Some demos:**
Before selling these on Tindie, I have used them in many productions thus far. Most recently, on a ‘Christmas Cabaret’ performed by students at The Leys School, in their theatre  [(Leys Great Hall)](https://www.theleys.net/591/venue-hire/great-hall) where we used four of our 1st generation nodes to control some ETC Source Fours that were mounted above the stage in our flying rig. We were squished right up against our 6 Universe output limit, so the nodes came in really handy! It took us only a few minutes per node to have them all hooked up to our ETC Nomad System.
